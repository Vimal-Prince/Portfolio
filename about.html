        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring Game Artist, Concept Artist, 
          and Game Designer with a strong passion for creating engaging and visually compelling game experiences. My journey into game development comes from a lifelong fascination with how worlds, characters, and stories come alive through interactive media. I enjoy blending creativity with technical skills, and I work across both 2D and 3D art, 
          which allows me to adapt to different stages of the game pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the 2D side, I focus on concept art, character design, 
          and environment design. I enjoy brainstorming ideas, sketching visuals, and translating early concepts into polished assets that capture the mood and storytelling of a project. I believe strong concept art is the foundation of any game—it sets the direction, tone, 
          and overall feel—and that’s a role I love to take on.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the 3D side, I work on modeling, sculpting, texturing, and preparing game-ready assets. 
          I have experience with both hard-surface and organic modeling, and I aim to push myself further into sculpting, baking, retopology, and texturing workflows to ensure that my models are not only detailed but also optimized for game engines. 
          I use industry-standard tools such as Maya, ZBrush, Substance Painter, Photoshop, Unity, and Unreal Engine, 
          and I enjoy experimenting with different techniques to refine my process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond art, I am equally passionate about game design—thinking about player experience, level design, and mechanics. 
          I'm passionate about indiependent game development so I always learning about Visual storytelling.
          I like to understand how art and design come together to shape gameplay and how small creative decisions can affect immersion and storytelling. 
          This balance of artistic vision and design thinking is what drives me to keep learning and improving.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a fresher in the industry, I bring dedication, adaptability, 
          and a strong eagerness to learn. I’ve worked on personal projects and freelance experiences that helped me develop problem-solving skills, teamwork, and time management, 
          and I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others who share the same passion for games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, my goal is to grow into a versatile professional who can contribute to both the artistic and design aspects of game development. 
          I want to create experiences that not only look visually stunning but also connect with players on an emotional and interactive level.
